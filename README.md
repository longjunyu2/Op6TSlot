# Op6TSlot
Add A/B slot support for OnePlus 6T EFI-EDK2 firmware.

## Introduction
  The OnePlus 6T device uses the A/B slot mode proposed by AOSP. Each time it is started, the bootloader checks if the current slot is available or switches if not.
Therefore, when we use a non-Android system, bootloader will assume that the current slot used is damaged and switch between the slots, since the slot status cannot be updated.
When the same thing happens in another slot, bootloader forces it into fastboot.
  This UEFI Application module is designed to automatically update the slot state after entering UEFI firmware, without requiring an OS level solution to this problem.
